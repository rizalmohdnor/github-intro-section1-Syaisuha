# RUSYAIDA 101

😁Hai, I am rusyaida, but feel free to call me Syai. I am a final year student, studying software engineering.
While we are on this topic, I am looking for an internship placement from early march to September, so hmu if there is any available in your company! 

I am mainly here because of my class, but I am still interested in looking for exciting projects(👀) I could participate in!
My current interest is in AI, I am currently doing an application on AI chatbot mental health, but I am still shy to share it here hehe.💃🏻💃🏻

## More about me
I love reading manhwa, hiking and buying books ( I read them too, I swear)

Here is the preview for my application. It will probably be done next year. We are still working on the AI part. Wish us luck!!
