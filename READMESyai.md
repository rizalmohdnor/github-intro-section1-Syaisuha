# RUSYAIDA 101

:_bow: Hai, I am rusyaida, but feel free to call me Syai. I am a final year student, studying software enginneering.
While we are on this topic, I am looking for an internship placement from early march to september, so hmu if there is any available in your company! :_badger:

I am mainly here because of my class but still interested in looking for exciting projects(ðŸ‘€)i could partake in!
My current interest is in AI, I am currently doing an application on AI chatbot mental health, but still shy to share it here hehe.

## More about me
I love reading manhwa, hiking and buying books ( I read them too, i swear)

Here is the preview for my application, its probably will be done next year, we are still working on the AI part. Wish us luck!!
